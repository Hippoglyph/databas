2. Give the name and area of the worlds northemmost desert

SELECT name
FROM desert

ORDER BY (coordinates).latitude DESC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY;

3. Generate a table of all the mountains ranges that contain at least 3 mountains and the number of countries each range touches

SELECT mountains as mountainRange, count(*) as countriesTouches
FROM (
	SELECT DISTINCT mountains, country
	FROM mountain, geo_mountain
	WHERE mountain.mountains in (
		SELECT mountains
		FROM (
			SELECT mountains, count(*) as numberOfMountains FROM mountain
			WHERE mountains IS NOT NULL
			GROUP BY mountains
			) as Foo
		WHERE numberOfMountains >= 3
		) AND geo_mountain.mountain = mountain.name
	) as bar
GROUP BY mountains;

4. Which hemisphere has the largest lake/desert area ratio, the eastern or the western

SELECT *
FROM
	(SELECT wLake.lakeA/wDesert.desertA as westRatio
	FROM
		(SELECT SUM(area) as lakeA
		FROM lake
		WHERE (coordinates).longitude < 0) as wLake
		,
		(SELECT SUM(area) as desertA
		FROM desert
		WHERE (coordinates).longitude < 0) as wDesert) as western
	,
	(SELECT eLake.lakeA/eDesert.desertA as eastRatio
	FROM
		(SELECT SUM(area) as lakeA
		FROM lake
		WHERE (coordinates).longitude > 0) as eLake
		,
		(SELECT SUM(area) as desertA
		FROM desert
		WHERE (coordinates).longitude > 0) as eDesert) as eastern;

5. Generate the continent names and the number of cities on each continent that are situated no more then 35 degrees from the Equator, for those continents that have an land area above 9000000 sq km

SELECT continent.name as continent, count(*) as cities
FROM
	(SELECT country, continent FROM encompasses) as encompasses,
	(SELECT code FROM country) as country,
	(SELECT name FROM continent WHERE area > 9000000) as continent,
	city
WHERE country.code = encompasses.country AND encompasses.continent = continent.name AND city.country = country.code AND (city.latitude BETWEEN -35 AND 35)
GROUP BY continent.name;

6. List the number of rivers for each European country in decending order

SELECT countryName.name as country, count(*) as rivers
FROM
	(SELECT country FROM encompasses WHERE continent = 'Europe') as country,
	(SELECT DISTINCT river, country FROM geo_river) as river,
	(SELECT name, code FROM country) as countryName
WHERE river.country = country.country AND country.country = countryName.code
GROUP BY countryName.name
ORDER BY rivers DESC;

7. Name of the organizations in Europe containing the word 'Nuclear', with an unknown date of establishment

SELECT name
FROM
	(SELECT country FROM encompasses WHERE continent = 'Europe') as country,
	organization
WHERE organization.country = country.country AND organization.established IS NULL AND organization.name LIKE '%Nuclear%';

8. Show a list of country name and projected populations in 10, 25,50 and 100 years if current demographic trends continue unabated.

SELECT country.name as country, country.population as year0, 
ROUND(country.population*POWER((population.population_growth/100) + 1, 10)) as year10, 
ROUND(country.population*POWER((population.population_growth/100) + 1, 25)) as year25, 
ROUND(country.population*POWER((population.population_growth/100) + 1, 50)) as year50, 
ROUND(country.population*POWER((population.population_growth/100) + 1, 100)) as year100
FROM population, country
WHERE population.country = country.code;

9. Create a view EightThousanders(name,mountains,height,coordinates) which includes the mountains over or equal to the height of 8000 meters. 
Query for the countries including EightThousanders. Try to avoid materializing the whole Mountain relation. Verify via EXPLAIN ANALYSE.

-- CREATE table EightThousanders(
-- 	name character varying(35) PRIMARY KEY,
-- 	mountains character varying(35),
-- 	height numeric,
-- 	coordinates geocoord CHECK ((coordinates).longitude >= (-180)::numeric AND (coordinates).longitude <= 180::numeric AND (coordinates).latitude >= (-90)::numeric AND (coordinates).latitude <= 90::numeric)
-- );

-- INSERT INTO EightThousanders
-- SELECT name, mountains, height, coordinates
-- FROM mountain
-- WHERE height >= 8000;

CREATE VIEW EightThousanders AS
SELECT name, mountains, height, coordinates
FROM mountain
WHERE height >= 8000;

SELECT DISTINCT country.name
FROM country,geo_mountain,EightThousanders
WHERE country.code = geo_mountain.country AND geo_mountain.mountain = EightThousanders.name;

10. Give names of all the countries (recursively) reachable from Sweden via borders

WITH RECURSIVE temp(visited) AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        CASE 
        	WHEN country2 = 'S' THEN country1
            ELSE country2
        END AS country
    FROM borders 
    WHERE country1 = 'S' OR country2 = 'S'
    UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT
        CASE 
        	WHEN country2 = visited THEN country1
            ELSE country2
        END AS country      
    FROM borders, temp
    WHERE (not(visited = country1) AND visited = country2) or (not(visited = country2) AND visited = country1)
)
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM temp, country
WHERE visited = code
ORDER BY name;
